# WebGL-Library
A simple library for WebGL

<b>UNDER DEVELOPMENT</b>

I made this project to work on my WebGL and also create a library for easy additions to any website.

So far, I have used resources from the following sources:
<ul>
  <li>https://github.com/KhronosGroup/WebGL - common/J3DI*.js and common/webgl-utils.js</li>
  <li>My CSCE 470 Course by Hongfeng Yu - MV.js</li>
  <li>My CSCE 470 Project https://github.com/cheble/Solar-System-Model-WebGL - various code</li>
</ul>
